#### Palette
`palette.json` contains one key - `palette` and this is map, there:
- `key` is user based uniq sequence
- `value` is patterned sequence that might be contains (ordered):
  1. `<CTL>` Ð°s control (predefined in `controls.go`) sequence
  2. `<F8/B8>` if u mean using 8-bit colors
  3. `<COLOR>` color val: `30-37 (Basic Foreground)`, `40-47 (Basic Background)`, `0-255 (8-bit color table)`, `#FFFFFF 8-bit colors`

All of `value` parts must be delimited by `:` \
